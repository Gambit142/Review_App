      "In medium bowl mix soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, Serrano pepper, lime juice, mint, and sesame seeds. Then add diced tuna and toss to coat.The tuna is ready to eat as soon as it's tossed and coated but you can marinate it for a few minutes if desired. The tuna will start to turn white almost immediately, a sign that it is cooking from the acidity of the lime juice. It is not necessary to cook the tuna. In fact, it is best served immediately while it is melt-in-your-mouth tender and moist.",
      "Serve immediately by mounding atop crackers, chips, micro-greens, or even roasted sweet potato slices."
