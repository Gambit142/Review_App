Stir to combine Very slowly pour the wet ingredients into the mixer with the dry ingredients about a quarter of a cup at a time (similar idea to making pie crust), mixing on medium speed. Once all the wet ingredients are combined with the dry, add chopped walnuts and mix until integrated into the dough. Taking the dough in your hands, form it into a disc shape. Refrigerate in a sealable container or plastic wrap for 1 hour.",

Press the remaining frozen cherries into the top of the dough. Using a serrated knife, cut diagonals into the dough in order to create eight triangles. Arrange on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet (be sure to give the triangles enough space to bake evenly).",
      "Bake for 23 minutes or until the tops of the scones are golden brown.",
